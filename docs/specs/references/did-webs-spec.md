## Abstract

This document specifies a [DID
Method](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/#methods),
`did:webs`, that is web-based but innovatively secure. Like its
interoperable cousin, [`did:web`](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/), the
`did:webs` method uses traditional web infrastructure to publish DIDs and
make them discoverable. Unlike `did:web`, this method's trust is not rooted in
DNS, webmasters, X509, and certificate authorities. Instead, it uses [[ref:
KERI]] to provide a secure chain of cryptographic key events by those who
control the identifier including any of its delegators.

The `did:webs` method does not need blockchains to establish trust. However, its use of
KERI allows for arbitrary blockchains to be referenced as an extra, optional
publication mechanism. This offers a potentital interoperability bridge from (or between)
blockchain ecosystems. Also, without directly supporting environments where the
web is not practical (e.g., IOT, Lo-Ra, Bluetooth, NFC), the method builds on a
foundation that can fully support those environments, making future interop of
identifiers between web and non-web a manageable step for users of `did:webs` identifiers.

All DID methods make tradeoffs. The ones in `did:webs` result in a method that
is cheap, easy to implement, and scalable. No exotic or unproven cryptography is
required. Deployment is straightforward. Cryptographic trust is strongly
decentralized and governance is transparent. Signing authority is scalable through the
support of delegated identifiers. Regulatory challenges around the issue of
blockchains vanish. Any tech community or legal jurisdiction can use it. However,
`did:webs` _does_ depend on the web for publication and discovery. This may
color its decentralization and privacy. For its security, it adds [[ref: KERI]]. For users, the method also raises
the bar of accountability, thoughtfulness, and autonomy; this can be viewed as
either a drawback or a benefit (or both).

## introduction
## Introduction
::: informative Introduction

DID methods answer many questions. Two noteworthy ones are:

*   How is information about DIDs (in the form of DID documents) published and discovered?
*   How is the trustworthiness of this information evaluated?

The previously released `did:web` method merges these two questions, giving one answer: _Information is published and secured using familiar web mechanisms_. This has wonderful adoption benefits, because the processes and tooling are familiar to millions of developers.

Unfortunately, this answer works better for the first question than the second. The current web is simply not very trustworthy. Websites get hacked. Sysadmins are sometimes malicious. DNS can be hijacked. X509 certs often prove less than clients wish. Browser validation checks are imperfect. Different certificate authorities have different quality standards. The processes that browser vendors use to pre-approve certificate authorities in browsers are opaque and centralized. TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks on intranets with customized certificate chains. Governance is weak and inconsistent...

Furthermore, familiar web mechanisms are almost always operated by corporate IT staff. This makes them an awkward fit for the ideal of decentralized autonomy — even if individuals can publish a DID on corporate web servers, those individuals are at the mercy of IT personnel for their security.

The `did:webs` method described in this spec separates these two questions and answers them distinctively. _Information about DIDs_ is still published on the web, but its _trustworthiness_ derives from mechanisms entirely governed by individual DID controllers. This preserves most of the delightful convenience of `did:web`, while drastically upgrading security through authentic data that is end-verifiable.

Within the context of `did:webs` the term *decentralized trust* includes verifiability, confidentiality, and privacy, but excludes veracity of the content. The latter is always a matter of (personal) evaluation of available reputational data and verifiable credentials (VCs).

As a preview of syntax, see the below sample did:webs DID:

## core
## Core Characteristics
This section is normative.

### Method Name

1. The method name that identifies this DID method SHALL be: `webs`.
1. A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix: `did:webs:`.
1. Per the DID specification, this string MUST be lower case.
1. The remainder of the DID, after the prefix, MUST be the case-sensitive [[ref: method-specific identifier]]
([[ref: MSI]]) described [below](#method-specific-identifier).

::: informative Note on pronunciation
Note: when pronounced aloud, “webs” should become two syllables: the word “web” and the letter “s” (which stands for “secure”). Separating the final letter this way emphasizes that the method offers a security upgrade surpassing the one HTTPS gives to HTTP.
:::

### Method-Specific Identifier

1. The `did:webs` [[ref: method-specific identifier]] MUST have two parts, a [[ref: host]] with an optional path (identical to `did:web`), plus a KERI AID (autonomic identifier) that is always the final component of the path.
1. The ABNF definition of a `did:webs` DID MUST be as follows:

```abnf
; did:webs DID structure
webs-did = "did:webs:" host [pct-encoded-colon port] *(":" path) ":" aid

; 'host' as defined in RFC 1035, RFC 1123, and RFC 2181
host = *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." )
; Simplified representation; actual RFCs have more complex rules for domains and IP addresses.
; In actual implementations replace with a mature host parsing library.

; 'pct-encoded-colon' represents a percent-encoded colon
pct-encoded-colon = "%3A" / "%3a" ; Percent encoding for ':'

; 'port' number (simplified version)
port = 1*5(DIGIT)

; 'path' definition
path = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_" / "~" / "." / "/")

aid = said

; AID is a KERI SAID; SAID structure:
said = said-256 / said-512

; Base64URLSafe characters (RFC 4648, excluding padding)
base64urlsafe = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_"

; The complete SAID primitive MUST conform to CESR code table [2], CESR spec Section 11.4.
; The following currently defined digest codes, for example, produce SAIDs of 44 or 88 characters total.

; 256-bit SAIDs: 44 characters total (1 char code + 43 Base64URLSafe)
one-char-code = "E" / "F" / "G" / "H" / "I"
said-256 = one-char-code 43base64urlsafe

; 512-bit SAIDs: 88 characters total (2 char code + 86 Base64URLSafe)
two-char-code = "0D" / "0E" / "0F" / "0G"
said-512 = two-char-code 86base64urlsafe
```

1. The [[ref: host]] MUST abide by the formal rules describing valid syntax found in [[ref: RFC1035]], [[ref: RFC1123]], and [[ref: RFC2181]].
1. A port MAY be included and the colon MUST be percent encoded, like `%3a`, to prevent a conflict with paths.
1. Directories and subdirectories MAY optionally be included, delimited by colons rather than slashes.
1. The KERI AID is a unique identifier and MUST be derived from the [[ref: inception event]] of a KERI identifier.

::: informative did:web compatibility
To be compatible with `did:web`, the AID is "just a path", the final (and perhaps only) path element. The presence of the required AID as a path element means that a `did:webs` always has a path,and so the "no path" version of a `did:web` that implicitly uses the `.well-known` location is not supported by `did:webs`. Any `did:webs` can be expressed as a `did:web` but the inverse is not true--a `did:webs` must include an AID.
:::

### Target System(s)
1. As with `did:web`, `did:webs` MUST read data from whatever web server is referenced when the [[ref: host]] portion of one of its DID is resolved.
1. A `did:webs` DID MUST resolve to a [[ref: DID document]] using a simple text transformation to an HTTPS URL in the same way as a `did:web` DID.
1. A `did:web` DID and `did:webs` DID with the same [[ref: method-specific identifier]] SHOULD return the same DID document, except for minor differences in the `id`, `controller`, and `alsoKnownAs` top-level properties that pertain to the identifiers themselves.
1. As with `did:web`, the location of the `did:webs` [[ref: DID document]] MUST be determined by transforming the DID to an HTTPS URL as follows:
    1. MUST replace `did:webs` with `https://`
    1. MUST replace the "`:`"s in the method-specific identifier with path separators, "'/'"s
    1. MUST convert the optional port percent encoding ("`%3A`") to a colon if present.
    1. MUST append "`/did.json`" to the resulting string.
1. A GET on that URL MUST return the DID document.
1. The location of the [[ref: KERI event stream]] MUST be determined by transforming the previous URL as follows:
    1. MUST replace the trailing "`/did.json`" with "`/keri.cesr`".
    2. A GET on that URL MUST return the KERI event stream for the AID in the `did:webs` identifier.
    3. The KERI event stream MUST be [[ref: CESR]]-formatted (media type of application/cesr) and the KERI events must be verifiable using the KERI rules.
2. The `did:web` version of the DIDs MUST be the same (minus the `s`) and point to the same `did.json` file, but have no knowledge of the `keri.cesr` file.

::: informative Target system and KERI verifiability
For more information, see the following sections in the implementors guide:
* [the set of KERI features needed](#the-set-of-keri-features-needed) to support `did:webs`

A target system cannot forge or tamper with data protected by KERI, and if it deliberately serves an outdated copy, the duplicity is often detectable. Thus, any given target system in isolation can be viewed by this method as a dumb, untrusted server of content. It is the combination of target systems and some KERI mechanisms, _together_, that constitutes this method's verifiable data registry. In short, verifying the DID document by processing the [[ref: KERI event stream]] using KERI puts the "s" of "security" in `did:webs`.

The following are some example `did:webs` DIDs and their corresponding DID documents and KERI event stream URLs, based on the examples from the [[ref: did:web Specification]], but with the (faked) AID
`12124313423525` added:
* `did:webs:w3c-ccg.github.io:12124313423525`
  * The DID document URL would look like: `https://w3c-ccg.github.io/12124313423525/did.json`
  * [[ref: KERI event stream]] URL would look like: `https://w3c-ccg.github.io/12124313423525/keri.cesr`
* `did:webs:w3c-ccg.github.io:user:alice:12124313423525`
  * The DID document URL would look like: `https://w3c-ccg.github.io/user/alice/12124313423525/did.json`
  * [[ref: KERI event stream]] URL would look like: `https://w3c-ccg.github.io/user/alice/12124313423525/keri.cesr`
* `did:webs:example.com%3A3000:user:alice:12124313423525`
  * The DID document URL would look like: `https://example.com:3000/user/alice/12124313423525/did.json`
  * [[ref: KERI event stream]] URL would look like: `https://example.com:3000/user/alice/12124313423525/keri.cesr`

:::

### AID controlled identifiers
1. [[ref: AID controlled identifiers]] MAY vary in how quickly they reflect the current identity information, DID document and [[ref: KERI event stream]]. Notably, as defined in section [Stable Identifiers On An Unstable Web](#stable-identifiers-on-an-unstable-web), the `id` property in the DID document will differ based on the web location of the DID document.
1. Different versions of the DID document and KERI event stream MAY reside in different locations depending on the replication capabilities of the controlling entity.
2. If the KERI event streams differ for `did:webs` DIDs with the same AID, the smaller KERI event stream MUST be a prefix of the larger KERI event stream (e.g., the only difference in the [[ref: KERI event streams]] being the extra events in one of the KERI event streams, not yet reflected in the other).
3. If the KERI event streams diverge from one other (e.g., one is not a subset of the other), both the KERI event streams and the DIDs MUST be considered invalid.
4. The verification of the KERI event stream SHOULD provide mechanisms for detecting the forking of the KERI event stream by using mechanisms such as KERI witnesses and watchers.

::: informative AID and KERI event stream binding
Since an AID is a unique cryptographic identifier that is inseparably bound to the [[ref: KERI event stream]] it is associated with any AIDs and any `did:webs` DIDs that have the same AID component. It can be verifiably proven that they have the same controller(s).
:::

### Handling Web Redirection

1. A `did:webs` DID MAY be a "stable" (long-lasting) identifier that can be put into documents such as verifiable credentials, to be useful for a very long time -- generations.
1. When a `did:webs` DID is updated for another location the following rules MUST apply:
    1. Its AID MUST not change.
    1. The same [[ref: KERI event stream]] MUST be used to verify the DID document, with the only change being the [[ref: designated aliases]] list reflecting the new location identifier.
    1. If a resolver can find a newly named DID that uses the same AID, and the KERI event stream verifies the DID, then the resolver MAY consider the resolution to be successful and should note it in the resolution metadata. 

1. The following resolution paths that `did:webs` identfiers SHALL leverage to help in the face of resolution uncertainty includes:
    1. The `did:webs` DID SHALL provide other [[ref: designated aliases]] DID(s) that are anchored to the [[ref: KERI event stream]].
    1. When a `did:webs` DID is permanently moved to some other location the resolver MAY redirect to any other `equivalentId` [[ref: designated aliases]].
        1. The `id` in the DID document MUST be set to the new location.
        1. An `equivalentId` entry of the old location SHOULD remain for historical purposes and be anchored to the KERI event stream using [[ref: designated aliases]]. See section [Use of `equivalentId`](#use-of-equivalentid) for more details.
        1. If possible, the controller of the DID MAY use web redirects to allow resolution of the old location of the DID to the new location.
    1. If the previously published location of a `did:webs` DID is not redirected, an entity trying to resolve the DID MAY be able to find the data for the DID somewhere else using just the AID.

### DID Method Operations

#### Create

1. Creating a `did:webs` DID MUST follow these rules:
    1. MUST choose the web URL where the DID document for the DID will be published, excluding the last element that will be the AID, once defined.
    1. MUST create a KERI AID and add it as the last element of the web URL for the DID.
    1. MUST add the appropriate KERI events to the AID's KERI logs that will correspond to properties of the DID document, such as verification methods and service endpoints.
    1. MUST derive the `did:webs` [[ref: DID document]] by processing the [[ref: KERI event stream]] according to section [DID Documents](#did-documents).
    1. For compatibility reasons, transformation of the derived `did:webs` DID document to the corresponding `did:web` DID document MUST be according to section [Transformation to did:web DID Document](#transformation-to-didweb-did-document).
    1. MUST make the did:web DID document resource (`did.json`) and the [[ref: KERI event stream]] resource (`keri.cesr`) available at the selected location. See section [Target System(s)](#target-systems) for further details about the locations of these resources.

::: informative Publishing and hosting
Of course, the web server that serves the resources when asked might be a simple file server (as implied above) or an active component that generates them dynamically. Further, the publisher of the resources placed on the web can use capabilities like [CDNs] to distribute the resources. How the resources are posted at the required location is not defined by this spec; complying implementations need not support any HTTP methods other than GET.

An active component might be used by the controller of the DID to automate the process of publishing and updating the DID document and [[ref: KERI event stream]] resources.
:::

#### Read (Resolve)

1. Resolving a `did:webs` DID MUST follow these steps:
    1. MUST convert the `did:webs` DID back to HTTPS URLs as described in section [Target System(s)](#target-systems).
    1. MUST execute HTTP GET requests on both the URL for the DID document (ending in `/did.json`) and the URL for the [[ref: KERI event stream]] (ending in `/keri.cesr`).
    1. MUST process the KERI event stream using [[ref: KERI Protocol]] Rules to verify it, then derive the `did:webs` [[ref: DID document]] by processing the KERI event stream according to section [DID Documents](#did-documents).
    1. MUST transform the retrieved `did:web` DID document to the corresponding `did:webs` DID document according to section [Transformation to did:webs DID Document](#transformation-to-didwebs-did-document).
    1. MUST verify that the derived `did:webs` DID document equals the transformed DID document.
    2. KERI-aware applications MAY use the KERI event stream to make use of additional capabilities enabled by the use of KERI.

::: informative Scope of KERI capabilities
Capabilities beyond the verification of the DID document, the KERI event stream, and delegated identifiers are outside the scope of this specification.
:::

#### Update

1. If the AID of the `did:webs` DID is updatable, updates MUST be made to the AID by adding KERI events to
the [[ref: KERI event stream]].
1. Updates to the KERI event stream that relate to the `did:webs` DID MUST be reflected in the DID Document as soon as possible.
    1. If the `did:webs` DID files are statically hosted then they MUST be republished to the web server, overwriting the existing files.

#### Deactivate

1. To deactivate a `did:webs` DID, A controller SHOULD execute a KERI event that has the effect of rotating the key(s) to null and continue to publish the DID document and KERI event stream.
    1. Once the deactivation events have been applied, the controller SHOULD regenerate the DID document from the [[ref: KERI event stream]] and republish both documents (`did.json` and `keri.cesr`) to the web server, overwriting the existing files.
    1. A controller SHOULD NOT make the DID document and [[ref: KERI event stream]] resources unavailable at the location where they have been published.
        ::: informative Rationale for not removing DID files
        This is considered to be a bad approach, as those resolving the DID will not be able to determine if the web service is offline or the DID has been deactivated.

## keri
## KERI Fundamentals
::: informative KERI Fundamentals

[[ref: Key Event Receipt Infrastructure)]] is a protocol for managing cryptographic keys, identifiers, and associated verifiable data structures. KERI was first described in an [academic paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02143), and its [specification](https://github.com/trustoverip/tswg-keri-specification) is currently incubated under [Trust Over IP Foundation](https://trustoverip.org/). The open source community that develops KERI-related technologies can be found at `https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keri`. This section outlines the fundamentals and components of the KERI protocol that are related to the `did:webs` method.

### Autonomic Identifier (AID)

An [[ref: autonomic identifier]] is a globally-unique persistent self-certifying identifier that serves as the primary root-of-trust of the KERI protocol. An AID is cryptographically bound to a [[ref: KEL]] that determines the evolution of its [[ref: key state]] using the [[ref: pre-rotation]] mechanism. AIDs and the underlying KERI protocol, by themselves, satisfy most of the [properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#design-goals) that DIDs require, including decentralization, control, security, proof-based, and portability. For example, DIDs that have the same AID component are considered [equivalent](#equivalent-identifiers), allowing AIDs to be portable across different DID methods such as `did:webs` and `did:keri`.

### Key Event Log (KEL)

The binding between an [[ref: AID]] and its cryptographic keys is proved by a data structure called a [[ref: key event log]] that allows the [[ref: key states]] of the AID to evolve. For a `did:webs` DID, a KEL is an essential component in the [[ref: KERI event stream]] that is used to verify its authenticity.

A KEL is a hash-chain append-only log and can be considered a variant of blockchain. However, a KEL differs from the traditional blockchain technology in at least two important ways:

* It records the [[ref: key event]] history of a single AID with a single [[ref: controller]], instead of an arbitrarily large collection updated by other participants in the network. This makes a KEL memory-efficient, fast, cheap, and trivially scalable.
* It is fully [[ref: self-certifying]], meaning its correctness can be proved by direct inspection, without a distributed consensus algorithm or assumptions about trust in an external data source or its governance.

These properties allows a KEL to be published anywhere, without special guarantees from its storage mechanism. For example, a KEL of an AID could be published and migrated between different KERI-compatible blockchain networks that use different DID methods. A KEL also records changes to key types and cryptographic algorithms, providing the AID portability and adaptability to multiple ecosystems throughout its lifecycle.

### AID Derivation

The value of an [[ref: AID]] is derived from the first [[ref: key event]], called the [[ref: inception event]], of a [[ref: KEL]]. The inception event includes inital public key(s), called the _current_ key(s), that can be used to control the AID. The cryptographic relationship between the AID and its keys eliminates an early chain-of-custody risk that plagues many other DID methods where an attacker uses compromised keys to create a DID without the DID controller's knowledge. This derivation process is similar to techniques used by `did:key`, `did:peer`, `did:sov`, and `did:v1`.

The simplest AIDs, called non-transferrable [[ref: direct mode]] AIDs, have no additional input to the derivation function, and expose a degenerate KEL that can hold only the inception event. This KEL is entirely derivable from the AID itself, and thus requires no external data. Non-transferrable direct mode AIDs are ideal for ephemeral use cases and are excellent analogs to `did:key` and `did:peer` with `numalgo=0`. This is by no means not the only option as KERI offers richer choices that are especially valuable if an AID is intended to have a long lifespan.

### Pre-rotation

Public keys in the [Verification Methods](#verification-methods) of a `did:webs` DID can be changed via a mechanism called [[ref: pre-rotation]]. With pre-rotation, the inception event of the associated AID also includes the hash(s) of the _next_ key(s) that can be used to change the [[ref: key state]] of the AID. AIDs with one or more pre-rotated _next_ keys are called _transferrable_ AIDs because their control can be transferred to new keys. AIDs that do not use pre-rotation cannot change their keys and are thus _non-transferrable_.

Pre-rotation has profound security benefits. If a malicious party steals the _current_ private key for a transferrable AID, they only accomplish _temporary_ mischief, because the already-existing KEL contains a commitment to a future state. This prevents them from rotating the stolen AID's key to an arbitrary value of their choosing. As soon as the AID controller suspects a compromise, they can change the key state of the AID using the pre-rotated _next_ key and locks the attacker out again.

### Weighted Multisig

The [[ref: KERI]] protocol supports weighted multi-signature scheme that allows for [conditional proof](#thresholds) in the [Verification Methods](#verification-methods). A multisig [[ref: AID]] distributes its control among multiple key holders. This includes simple M-of-N rules such as "3 of 5 keys must sign to change the AID's [[ref: key state]]". More sophisticated configurations are also supported: "Acme Corp's AID is controlled by the keys of 4 of 7 board members, or by the keys of the CEO and 2 board members, or by the keys of the CEO and the Chief Counsel."

The security and recovery benefits of this feature are obvious when an AID references organizational identity. However, even individuals can benefit from this, when stakes are high. They simply store different keys on different devices, and then configure how their devices constitute a management quorum. This decreases risks from lost phones, for example.

### Witnesses

In the [[ref: direct mode]], the [[ref: controller]] of an [[ref: AID]] is responsible for the distribution of its [[ref: KEL]]. Since the controller may not be highly available, the controller may designate additional supporting infrastructure, called [[ref: witnesses]], for the [[ref: indirect mode]] distribution of the [[ref: KELs]]. Witnesses may or may not be under direct control of the AID's controller and could be deployed on either centralized or decentralized architectures, including blockchains. The witnesses are embedded in the AID's [[ref: key event]] and, if included in the [[ref: inception event]], alter the AID value.

Unlike a blockchain with a distributed consensus mechanism, witnesses do not coordinate or come to consensus with one another during an update to its AID's [[ref: key event]] history. Hence, they need not be deeply trustworthy; merely by existing, they improve trust. This is because anyone changing an AID's key state or its set of witnesses, including the AID's legitimate controller, has to report those changes to the witnesses that are currently active, to produce a valid evolution of the KEL. The AID controller and all witnesses thus hold one another accountable. Further, it becomes possible to distinguish between duplicity and imperfect replication of key states.

### Transaction Event Log (TEL)

The [[ref: KERI]] protocol supports a verifiable data structure, called the [[ref: transaction event log]], that binds an [[ref: AID]] to non-repudiable data that is deterministically bound to the [[ref: key event]] history in the [[ref: KEL]]. Transactions that are recorded in a TEL may include things like the issuance and revocation of verifiable credentials or the fact that listeners on various service endpoints started or stopped. Like KELs, TELs are self-certifying and may also be published by KERI witnesses to enhance discoverability and provide watcher networks the ability to detect duplicity. For example, we demonstrate that in this spec in how we anchor [[ref: designated aliases]] as [verifiable data on a TEL](#verifiable-data-on-a-tel). 

### Web Independence

Although _this DID method depends on web technology, KERI itself does not_. It's as easy to create AIDs on IOT devices as it is on the web. AIDs offer the same features regardless of their origin and besides HTTP, they are shareable over Lo-Ra, Bluetooth, NFC, Low Earth Orbit satellite protocols, service buses on medical devices, and so forth. Thus, KERI's AIDs offer a bridge between a web-centric DID method and lower-level IOT ecosystems.

### Flexible Serialization

[[ref: KELs]] and [[ref: TELs]] of `did:webs` DIDs (i.e., AIDs) are included in the [[ref: KERI event streams]] for verification of the DID documents. The KERI event streams use [[ref: Composable Event Streaming Representation ([[ref: CESR]])]] for data serialization. Although CESR is a deep subject all by itself, at a high level, it has two essential properties:

*   **Content in CESR is self-describing and supports serialization as binary and text**: That is in [[ref: CESR]], _a digital signature on a CESR data structure is stable no matter which underlying serialization format is used_.  In effect it supports multiple popular serialization formats like JSON, CBOR, and MsgPack with room for many more. These formats can be freely mixed and combined in a CESR stream because of the self-describing nature of these individual CESR data structures.  The practical effect is that developers get the best of both worlds: they can produce and consume data as text to display and debug in a human-friendly form and they can store and transmit this data in its tersest form, _all without changing the signature on the data structures_.
*   **Cryptographic primitives are structured into compact standard representations**: Cryptographic primitives such as keys, hashes, digests, sealed-boxes, signatures, etc... are structured strings with a recognizable data type prefix and a standard representation in the stream. This means they are very terse and there is no need for the variety of representation methods that create interoperability challenges in other DID methods (`publicKeyJwk` versus `publicKeyMultibase` versus other; see the verification material section of the [[ref: DID specification]].

Despite this rich set of features, KERI imposes only light dependencies on developers. The cryptography it uses is familiar and battle-hardened, exactly what one would find in standard cryptography toolkits. For example, the python implementation (keripy) only depends on the `pysodium`, `blake3`, and `cryptography` python packages. Libraries for KERI exist in javascript, rust, and python.

## diddocuments
## DID Documents

This section is normative.

1. `did:webs` DID documents MUST be generated or derived from the [[ref: KERI event stream]] of the corresponding AID.
    1. Processing the KERI event stream of the AID, the generation algorithm MUST read the AID [[ref: KEL]] and any anchored [[ref: TELs]] to produce the DID document, including any designated alias ACDCs. 
2. `did:webs` DID documents MUST be pure JSON. They MAY be processed as JSON-LD by prepending an `@context` if consumers of the documents wish.
3. All hashes, cryptographic keys, and signatures MUST be represented as [[ref: CESR]] strings. This is an approach similar to [multibase](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase), making them self-describing and terse.

To better understand the cryptographically verifiable data structures used, see the implementors guide description of the [KERI event stream chain of custody](#KERI-event-stream-chain-of-custody). To understand the KERI AID commands resulting in the [[ref: KERI Event Stream]] and the corresponding `did:webs` DID document see the original [[ref: didwebs Reference Implementation]] [getting started guide](https://github.com/GLEIF-IT/did-webs-resolver/blob/main/docs/getting_started.md).

In KERI the calculated values that result from processing the [[ref: KERI event stream]] are referred to as the "current key state" and expressed
in the Key State Notice (KSN) record.  An example of a KERI KSN record can be seen here:

```json
{
    "v": "KERI10JSON000274_",
    "i": "EeS834LMlGVEOGR8WU3rzZ9M6HUv_vtF32pSXQXKP7jg",
    "s": "1",
    "t": "ksn",
    "p": "ESORkffLV3qHZljOcnijzhCyRT0aXM2XHGVoyd5ST-Iw",
    "d": "EtgNGVxYd6W0LViISr7RSn6ul8Yn92uyj2kiWzt51mHc",

    "kt": "1",
    "k": ["DTH0PwWwsrcO_4zGe7bUR-LJX_ZGBTRsmP-ZeJ7fVg_4"],
    "nt": 1,
    "n": ["E6qpfz7HeczuU3dAd1O9gPPS6-h_dCxZGYhU8UaDY2pc"],
    "bt": "3",
    "b": [
      "BGKVzj4ve0VSd8z_AmvhLg4lqcC_9WYX90k03q-R_Ydo",
      "BuyRFMideczFZoapylLIyCjSdhtqVb31wZkRKvPfNqkw",
      "Bgoq68HCmYNUDgOz4Skvlu306o_NY-NrYuKAVhk3Zh9c"
    ],
    "c": [],
    "ee": {
      "s": "0",
      "d": "ESORkffLV3qHZljOcnijzhCyRT0aXM2XHGVoyd5ST-Iw",
      "br": [],
      "ba": []
    },
    "di": ""
}
```

Using this key state as reference, we can identify the fields from the current key state that will translate to values
in the DID document.  The following table lists the values from the example KSN and their associated values in a DID document:

| Key State Field | Definition                             | DID Document Value                                                                           |
|:---------------:|:---------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       `i`       | The AID value                          | The DID Subject and DID Controller                                                           |
|       `k`       | The current set of public signing keys | Verification Methods with associated authentication and assertion verification relationships |
|      `kt`       | The current signing keys threshold     | The threshold in a Verification Method of type `ConditionalProof2022`                        |

In several cases above, the value from the key state is not enough by itself to populate the DID document.  The following
sections detail the algorithm to follow for each case.

:::

### DID Subject

This section is normative.

1. The value of the `id` property in the DID document MUST be the `did:webs` DID that is being created or resolved.
1. The value from the `i` field of the key state notice MUST be the value after the last `:` in the [[ref: method-specific identifier]] ([[ref: MSI]]) of the `did:webs` DID, according to the syntax rules in section [Method-Specific Identifier](#method-specific-identifier).

```json
{
  "id": "did:webs:example.com:Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M"
}
```

### DID Controller

This section is normative.

1. The value of the `controller` property MUST be a single string that is the same as the `id` (the DID Subject).

```json
{
  "controller": "did:webs:example.com:Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M"
}
```

### Also Known As

This section is normative.

1. The `alsoKnownAs` property in the root of the DID document MAY contain any DID that has the same AID. 
   ::: informative designated aliases reference
   See the [[ref: designated aliases]] section for information on how an AID anchors the `alsoKnownAs` identifiers to their [[ref: KERI event stream]].
   ::: 
   1. As long as the identifier is resolvable, a designated aliases ACDC containing a given identifier MUST always be present in the `keri.cesr` stream in order for any identifier to be included in the `alsoKnownAs` section of a `did:webs` DID document. 
      ::: informative transformation rules note
      Presence of designated alias ACDCs containing both `did:webs` and `did:web` identifiers are required to support the transformation rules between `did:webs` and `did:web` versions of a `did:webs` DID document while adhering to the security posture of KERI and ACDC.

      One potential way to implement this requirement is to ensure that resolving a given version of a `did:webs` DID document via the `versionId` parameter will return the DID document as of a given sequence number by analyzing the designated aliases ACDCs that were valid and unrevoked at that time.
      :::
   
1. The `did:webs` version of the DID document MUST include the `did:web` version of the DID as an `alsoKnownAs` identifier, meaning it must also be in a valid, un-revoked designated aliases ACDC present in the `keri.cesr` stream.
1. The `did:web` version of the DID document MUST include the `did:webs` version of the DID as an `alsoKnownAs` identifier, meaning it must also be in a valid, un-revoked designated aliases ACDC present in the `keri.cesr` stream.
1. In order for the `did:webs` DID document to be valid, the `keri.cesr` stream MUST contain at least ONE designated aliases ACDC in which the DNS name and path for the `did:webs` identifier are committed to for both the `did:webs` and `did:web` versions of the identifier.
   ::: informative
   Committed to means placed in a designated aliases ACDC.

   This implies that the `did.json` for both the `did:webs` and `did:web` versions of a `did:webs` DID document will always contain a reciprocal link to one another that is also committed to by an event anchored into the KEL of the DID controller.

   A consumer of a DID document can only know that a given `did:web` DID is trustable and committed to by the controller of the AID supporting a `did:webs` DID only when that `did:web` DID is included in an un-revoked designated aliases ACDC. 
   
   This protects against DID document malleability attacks where a malicious DID resolver host could inject fraudulent `did:web` DIDs into a DID document. As such, the consumer of a `did:webs` DID document should only trust `did:web` DIDs that are found in an un-revoked designated aliases ACDC present in the `keri.cesr` stream.
   ::: 
1. `did:webs` DIDs MUST provide the corresponding `did:keri` as an `alsoKnownAs` identifier.
1. The same AID MAY be associated with multiple `did:webs` DIDs, each with a different [[ref: host]] and/or path, but with the same AID.
1. `did:webs` DIDs MUST be listed in the Designated aliases attestation of the AID.
1. For each [[ref: AID controlled identifier]] DID defined above, an entry in the `alsoKnownAs` array in the DID document MUST be created.

::: informative example alsoKnownAs
For the example DID `did:webs:did-webs-service%3a7676:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe` the following `alsoKnownAs` entries could be created:
```json
{
  "alsoKnownAs": [
    "did:web:did-webs-service%3a7676:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
    "did:webs:did-webs-service%3a7676:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
    "did:web:example.com:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
    "did:web:foo.com:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
    "did:webs:foo.com:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe"
  ]
}
```
:::

### Verification Methods

This section is normative.

Each verification method for a `did:webs` DID is generated from signing keys located in the [[ref: KERI event stream]] of the controller of the `did:webs` DID.

1. For each key listed in the array value of the `k` field of the KSN, a corresponding verification method MUST be generated in the DID document.
1. The `type` property in the verification method for each public key MUST be determined by the algorithm used to generate the public key.
1. The verification method types used MUST be registered in the [DID Specification Registries](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-extensions-properties/#verification-relationships) and added to this specification.
1. The `id` property of the verification method MUST be a relative DID URL and use the KERI key [[ref: CESR]] value as the value of the fragment component, e.g., `"id": "#<identifier>"`.
1. The `controller` property of the verification method MUST be the value of the `id` property of the DID document.

   ::: informative controller and DID document id
   DID Core requires each verification method to have a `controller` property whose value is a valid DID, but does not require that value to equal the `id` of the DID document (e.g., delegation may use a different controller). This specification requires that for `did:webs` the `controller` of every verification method equals the document `id`, since all verification material is derived from the same AID's key state.
   :::

::: informative CESR and supported key types
KERI identifiers express public signing keys as Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR) encoded strings in the `k` field of establishment events and the key state notice.  CESR encoding encapsulates all the information needed to determine the cryptographic algorithm used to generate the key pair.

At the time of this writing, KERI currently supports public key generation for Ed25519, Secp256k1 and Secp256r1 keys, and the protocol allows for others to be added at any time.

For example, the key `DHr0-I-mMN7h6cLMOTRJkkfPuMd0vgQPrOk4Y3edaHjr` in the DID document for the AID `ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe` becomes:

```json
  "verificationMethod": [
    {"id": "#DHr0-I-mMN7h6cLMOTRJkkfPuMd0vgQPrOk4Y3edaHjr",
    "type": "JsonWebKey",
    "controller": "did:webs:did-webs-service%3a7676:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe", 
    "publicKeyJwk": {
      "kid": "DHr0-I-mMN7h6cLMOTRJkkfPuMd0vgQPrOk4Y3edaHjr", 
      "kty": "OKP", 
      "crv": "Ed25519", 
      "x": "evT4j6Yw3uHpwsw5NEmSR8-4x3S-BA-s6Thjd51oeOs"
      }
    }
  ]
```

:::

#### Ed25519
1. Ed25519 public keys MUST be converted to a verification method with a type of `JsonWebKey` and `publicKeyJwk` property whose value is generated by decoding the [[ref: CESR]] representation of the public key out of the KEL and into its binary form (minus the leading 'B' or 'D' CESR codes) and generating the corresponding representation of the key in JSON Web Key form.

For example, a KERI AID with only the following inception event in its KEL:
```json
{
  "v":"KERI10JSON00012b_",
  "t":"icp",
  "d":"ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
  "i":"ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
  "s":"0",
  "kt":"1",
  "k":["DHr0-I-mMN7h6cLMOTRJkkfPuMd0vgQPrOk4Y3edaHjr"],
  // ...
}
```
would result in a DID document with the following verification methods array:
```json
"verificationMethod": [
  {
    "id": "#DHr0-I-mMN7h6cLMOTRJkkfPuMd0vgQPrOk4Y3edaHjr", 
    "type": "JsonWebKey", 
    "controller": "did:webs:did-webs-service%3a7676:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe", 
    "publicKeyJwk": {
      "kid": "DHr0-I-mMN7h6cLMOTRJkkfPuMd0vgQPrOk4Y3edaHjr", 
      "kty": "OKP", 
      "crv": "Ed25519", 
      "x": "evT4j6Yw3uHpwsw5NEmSR8-4x3S-BA-s6Thjd51oeOs"
      }
  }
]
```

#### Secp256k1
1. Secp256k1 public keys MUST be converted to a verification method with a type of `JsonWebKey` and `publicKeyJwk` property whose value is generated by decoding the [[ref: CESR]] representation of the public key out of the KEL and into its binary form (minus the leading '1AAA' or '1AAB' CESR codes) and generating the corresponding representation of the key in JSON Web Key form.

For example, a KERI AID with only the following inception event in its KEL:
```json
{
  "v": "KERI10JSON0001ad_",
  "t": "icp",
  "d": "EDP1vHcw_wc4M__Fj53-cJaBnZZASd-aMTaSyWEQ-PC2",
  "i": "EDP1vHcw_wc4M__Fj53-cJaBnZZASd-aMTaSyWEQ-PC2",
  "s": "0",
  "kt": "1",
  "k": [
    "1AAAAmbFVu-Wf8NCd63B9V0zsy7EgB_ocX2_n_Nh1FCmgF0Y",
  ]
  // ...
}
```
would result in a DID document with the following verification methods array:

```json
  "verificationMethod": [
    {
      "id": "#1AAAAmbFVu-Wf8NCd63B9V0zsy7EgB_ocX2_n_Nh1FCmgF0Y",
      "type": "JsonWebKey",
      "controller": "did:webs:example.com:EDP1vHcw_wc4M__Fj53-cJaBnZZASd-aMTaSyWEQ-PC2",
      "publicKeyJwk": {
        "kid": "1AAAAmbFVu-Wf8NCd63B9V0zsy7EgB_ocX2_n_Nh1FCmgF0Y",
        "kty": "EC",

        "y": "Lu6Uw785U3K05D-NPNoUInHPNUz9cGqWwjKjm5KL8FI"
      }
    }
  ]
```

#### Thresholds
1. If the current signing keys threshold (the value of the `kt` field) is a string containing a number that is greater than 1, or if it is an array containing fractionally weighted thresholds, then in addition to the verification methods generated according to the rules in the previous sections, another verification method with a type of `ConditionalProof2022` MUST be generated in the DID document. This verification method type is defined [here](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/verifiable-conditions/).
    1. It MUST be constructed according to the following rules:
        1. The `id` property of the verification method MUST be a relative DID URL and use the AID as the value of the fragment component, e.g., `"id": "#<aid>"`.
        1. The `controller` property of the verification method MUST be the value of the `id` property of the DID document.
        1. If the value of the `kt` field is a string containing a number that is greater than 1 then the following rules MUST be applied:
            1. The `threshold` property of the verification method MUST be the integer value of the `kt` field in the current key state.
            1. The `conditionThreshold` property of the verification method MUST contain an array. For each key listed in the array value of the `k` field in the key state:
                1. The relative DID URL corresponding to the key MUST be added to the array value of the `conditionThreshold` property.
        1. If the value of the `kt` field is an array containing fractionally weighted thresholds then the following rules MUST be applied:
            1. The `threshold` property of the verification method MUST be the lowest common denominator (LCD) of all the fractions in the `kt` array.
            1. The `conditionWeightedThreshold` property of the verification method MUST contain an array. For each key listed in the array value of the `k` field in the key state, and for each corresponding fraction listed in the array value of the `kt` field:
                1. A JSON object MUST be added to the array value of the `conditionWeightedThreshold` property.
                1. The JSON object MUST contain a property `condition` whose value is the relative DID URL corresponding to the key.
                1. The JSON object MUST contain a property `weight` whose value is the numerator of the fraction after it has been expanded over the lowest common denominator (LCD) of all the fractions.

        For example, a KERI AID with only the following inception event in its KEL, and with a `kt` value greater than 1:
        ```json
        {
          "v": "KERI10JSON0001b7_",
          "t": "icp",
          "d": "Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M",
          "i": "Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M",
          "s": "0",
          "kt": "2",  // Signing Threshold
          "k": [
            "1AAAAg299p5IMvuw71HW_TlbzGq5cVOQ7bRbeDuhheF-DPYk",  // Secp256k1 Key
            "DA-vW9ynSkvOWv5e7idtikLANdS6pGO2IHJy7v0rypvE",      // Ed25519 Key
            "DLWJrsKIHrrn1Q1jy2oEi8Bmv6aEcwuyIqgngVf2nNwu"       // Ed25519 Key
          ],
        }
        ```
        results in a DID document with the following verification methods array:
        ```json
        {
          "verificationMethod": [
            {
              "id": "#Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M",

            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        For example, a KERI AID with only the following inception event in its KEL, and a `kt` containing fractionally weighted thresholds:
        ```json
        {

### Verification Relationships

This section is normative.

`did:webs` commits to same keys for both authentication and assertion, a design facilitated by being built upon KERI. This section defines how the dual use of keys for `authentication` and `assertionMethod` is reflected normatively in verification relationships. A `did:webs` DID document MAY include any of these, or other properties, to express a specific verification relationship. Both the `authentication` and `assertionMethod` properties are optional though if included MUST follow the rules stated in this section. When verification relationships are present in a `did:webs` DID document, each committed signing key for a given `did:webs` DID MUST show up as both an `authentication` and `assertionMethod` verification relationship in the DID document.

1. If the value of `kt` == 1 then the following rules MUST be applied:
    1. For each public key in `k` and its corresponding verification method, two verification relationships MUST be generated in the DID document. One verification relationship of type `authentication` and one verification relationship of type `assertionMethod`.
        1. The `authentication` verification relationship SHALL define that the DID controller can authenticate using each key.
        1. The `assertionMethod` verification relationship SHALL define that the DID controller can express claims using each key.
1. If the value of `kt` > 1 or if the value of `kt` is an array containing fractionally weighted thresholds then the following rules MUST be applied:
    1. For the verification method of type `ConditionalProof2022` (see section [Thresholds](#thresholds)), two verification relationships MUST be generated in the DID document. One verification relationship of type `authentication` and one verification relationship of type `assertionMethod`.
        1. The `authentication` verification relationship SHALL define that the DID controller can authenticate using a combination of multiple keys above the threshold.
        1. The `assertionMethod` verification relationship SHALL define that the DID controller can express claims using a combination of multiple keys above the threshold.
1. References to verification methods in the DID document MUST use the relative form of the identifier, e.g., `"authentication": ["#<identifier>"]`.

::: informative Use of private keys and key agreement
Private keys of a KERI AID can be used to sign a variety of data.  This includes but is not limited to logging into a website, challenge-response exchanges, credential issuances, etc.

For more information, see the [key agreement](#key-agreement) and [other key commitments](#other-key-commitments) section in the Implementors Guide.
:::

### Service Endpoints

This section is normative.

1. `did:webs` DIDs MUST support service endpoints, including types declared in the DID Specification Registries, such as [DIDCommMessaging](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-extensions-properties/#didcommmessaging).

::: informative Service endpoint mapping and metadata
For additional details about the mapping between KERI events and the Service Endpoints in the DID Document, see [Service Endpoint KERI events](#service-endpoint-event-details).

It is important to note that DID document service endpoints are different than the KERI service endpoints detailed in [KERI Service Endpoints as DID Document Metadata](#keri-service-endpoints-as-did-document-metadata).
:::

#### KERI Service Endpoints as DID Document Metadata
1. `did:webs` endpoints MUST be specified using the two data sets KERI uses to define service endpoints; Location Schemes and Endpoint Role Authorizations.
    1. Both MUST be expressed in KERI `rpy` events.
    1. For URL scheme endpoints that an AID has exposed, `did:webs` DIDs MUST use Location Schemes URLs.
    1. For endpoints that relate a role of one AID to another, `did:webs` DIDs MUST use KERI Endpoint Role Authorizations.

    For example, the following `rpy` method declares that the AID `EIDJUg2eR8YGZssffpuqQyiXcRVz2_Gw_fcAVWpUMie1` exposes the URL `http://localhost:3902` for scheme `http`:
    ```json
    {
        // ...
        "t": "rpy",
        "r": "/loc/scheme",
        "a": {
          "eid": "EIDJUg2eR8YGZssffpuqQyiXcRVz2_Gw_fcAVWpUMie1",
          "scheme": "http",
          "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3901/"
        }
      }
    ```
    For example, the AID listed in `cid` is the source of the authorization, the `role` is the role and the AID listed in the `eid` field is the target of the authorization.  So in this example `EOGL1KGpOnRaZDIB11uZDCkhHs52_MtMXHd7EqUqwtA3` is being authorized as an Agent for `EIDJUg2eR8YGZssffpuqQyiXcRVz2_Gw_fcAVWpUMie1`.
    ```json
    {
        // ...
        "t": "rpy",
        "r": "/end/role/add",
        "a": {
          "cid": "EIDJUg2eR8YGZssffpuqQyiXcRVz2_Gw_fcAVWpUMie1",
          "role": "agent",
          "eid": "EOGL1KGpOnRaZDIB11uZDCkhHs52_MtMXHd7EqUqwtA3"
        }
    }
    ```

1. KERI service endpoints roles beyond `witness` SHOULD be defined using Location Scheme and Endpoint Authorization records in KERI. See the [KERI specification](https://trustoverip.github.io/kswg-keri-specification/#oobi-url-iurl) For more information about KERI roles.

::: informative BADA-RUN and service endpoints
In KERI, service endpoints are defined by 2 sets of signed data using Best Available Data - Read, Update, Nullify ([[ref: BADA-RUN]]) rules for data processing.  The protocol ensures that all data is signed in transport and at rest and versioned to ensure only the latest signed data is available.

### Transformation to `did:web` DID Document

This section is normative.

The DID document that exists as a resource on a webserver is compatible with the `did:web` DID method and therefore necessarily different from a `did:webs` DID document with regard to the `id`, `controller`, and `alsoKnownAs` properties.
1. To transform the `did:webs` form of the DID Document to a `did:web` the transformation MUST do the following:
    1. In the values of the top-level `id` and `controller` properties of the DID document, the transformation MUST replace the `did:webs` prefix string with `did:web`.
    1. In the value of the top-level `alsoKnownAs` property, the transformation MUST replace the entry that is now the new value of the `id` property (using `did:web`) with the old value of the `id` property (using `did:webs`).
    1. All other content of the DID document MUST not be modified.

    For example, this transformation is used during the [Create](#create) DID method operation, given the following `did:webs` DID document:
    ```json
    {
        "id": "did:webs:did-webs-service%3a7676:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
        "verificationMethod": [
            {
                "id": "#DHr0-I-mMN7h6cLMOTRJkkfPuMd0vgQPrOk4Y3edaHjr",
                "type": "JsonWebKey",
                "controller": "did:webs:did-webs-service%3a7676:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
                "publicKeyJwk": {
                    "kid": "DHr0-I-mMN7h6cLMOTRJkkfPuMd0vgQPrOk4Y3edaHjr",
                    "kty": "OKP",
                    "crv": "Ed25519",
                    "x": "evT4j6Yw3uHpwsw5NEmSR8-4x3S-BA-s6Thjd51oeOs"
                }
            }
        ],
        "service": [],
        "alsoKnownAs": [
            "did:web:did-webs-service%3a7676:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
            "did:web:example.com:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
            "did:web:foo.com:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
            "did:webs:foo.com:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe"
        ]
    }
    ```
    the result of the transformation algorithm is the following `did:web` DID document:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "did:web:did-webs-service%3a7676:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
      "verificationMethod": [
          {
              "id": "#DHr0-I-mMN7h6cLMOTRJkkfPuMd0vgQPrOk4Y3edaHjr",
              "type": "JsonWebKey",
              "controller": "did:web:did-webs-service%3a7676:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
              "publicKeyJwk": {

              }
          }
      ],
      "service": [],
      "alsoKnownAs": [
          "did:webs:did-webs-service%3a7676:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",

### Transformation to `did:webs` DID Document

This section is normative.

This section defines an inverse transformation algorithm from a `did:web` DID document to a `did:webs` DID document.
1. Given a `did:web` DID document, a transformation to a `did:webs` DID document MUST have the following differences:
    1. In the values of the top-level `id` and `controller` properties of the DID document, the transformation MUST replace the `did:web` prefix string with `did:webs`.
    1. The value of the top-level `alsoKnownAs` property MUST replace the entry that is now the new value of the `id` property (using `did:webs`) with the old value of the `id` property (using `did:web`).
    1. All other content of the DID document MUST not be modificatied.
1. A `did:webs` resolver MUST use this transformation during the [Read (Resolve)](#read-resolve) DID method operation.

    For example, given the following `did:web` DID document:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "did:web:did-webs-service%3a7676:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
      "verificationMethod": [
          {
              "id": "#DHr0-I-mMN7h6cLMOTRJkkfPuMd0vgQPrOk4Y3edaHjr",
              "type": "JsonWebKey",
              "controller": "did:web:did-webs-service%3a7676:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
              "publicKeyJwk": {
                  "kid": "DHr0-I-mMN7h6cLMOTRJkkfPuMd0vgQPrOk4Y3edaHjr",
                  "kty": "OKP",
                  "crv": "Ed25519",
                  "x": "evT4j6Yw3uHpwsw5NEmSR8-4x3S-BA-s6Thjd51oeOs"
              }
          }
      ],
      "service": [],
      "alsoKnownAs": [
          "did:webs:did-webs-service%3a7676:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
          "did:web:example.com:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
          "did:web:foo.com:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
          "did:webs:foo.com:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe"
      ]
    }
    ```
    the result of the transformation algorithm is the following `did:webs` DID document:
    ```json
    {
        "id": "did:webs:did-webs-service%3a7676:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
        "verificationMethod": [

                "type": "JsonWebKey",
                "controller": "did:webs:did-webs-service%3a7676:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
                "publicKeyJwk": {

                    "crv": "Ed25519",
                    "x": "evT4j6Yw3uHpwsw5NEmSR8-4x3S-BA-s6Thjd51oeOs"
                }
            }
        ],
        "service": [],
        "alsoKnownAs": [
            "did:web:did-webs-service%3a7676:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
            "did:web:example.com:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
            "did:web:foo.com:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",
            "did:webs:foo.com:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe"
        ]
    }
    ```

### Full Example
::: informative Full Example

To walk through a real-world example, please see the GETTING STARTED guide in the [[ref: didwebs Reference Implementation]] as it walks users through many did:webs related tasks (and associated KERI commands) to demonstrate how they work together.

The following blocks contain fully annotated examples of a KERI AID with two events, an [[ref: inception event]] and an [[ref: interaction event]].
* The Inception event designates some [[ref: witnesses]] in the `b` field.
* The Inception event designates multiple public signing keys in the `k` field.
* The Inception event designates multiple rotation keys in the `n` field.
* The Interaction event cryptographically anchors data associated with the SAID `EoLNCdag8PlHpsIwzbwe7uVNcPE1mTr-e1o9nCIDPWgM`.
* The reply `rpy` events specify an Agent endpoint, etc.

Below, we show the KERI Event Stream that will be associated with the resulting generated DID document. These documents were generated for the `example.com` domain with no associated port or additional path defined:

### Basic KERI event details

This section is normative.

[DID Documents](#did-documents) introduced the core [[ref: KERI event stream]] and related DID Document concepts. This section provides additional details regarding the basic types of KERI events and how they relate to the DID document.

#### Key state events
1. When processing the KERI event stream `did:webs` MUST account for two broad types of key state events (KERI parlance is 'establishment events') that can alter the key state of the AID.
1. Any change in key state of the AID MUST be reflected in the DID document.
1. If a key state event does not commit to a future set of rotation key hashes, then the AID SHALL NOT be rotated to new keys in the future (KERI parlance is that the key state of the AID becomes 'non-transferrable').
1. If a key state event does commit to a future set of rotation key hashes, then any future key state rotation MUST be to those commitment keys. This foundation of [[ref: pre-rotation]] is post-quantum safe and allows the `did:webs` controller to recover from key compromise.
1. The [[ref: Inception event]] MUST be the first event in the [[ref: KEL]] that establishes the AID.  
    1. This MUST define the initial key set
    1. If the controller(s) desire future key rotation (transfer) then the inception event MUST commit to a set of future rotation key hashes.
    1. When processing the [[ref: KERI event stream]], if there are no rotation events after the inception event, then this is the current key state of the AID and MUST be reflected in the DID Document as specified in [Verification Methods](#verification-methods) and [Verification Relationships](#verification-relationships). 
1. [[ref: Rotation events]] MUST come after inception events.
1. If the controller(s) desires future key rotation (transfer) then the rotation event MUST commit to a set of future rotation key hashes.
1. Rotation events MUST only change the key state to the previously committed to rotation keys.
1. Either the inception event or the last rotation event, if any, is the current key state of the AID and MUST be reflected in the DID Document as specified in [Verification Methods](#verification-methods) and [Verification Relationships](#verification-relationships).

::: informative KERI event references
You can learn more about the inception event in the [[ref: KERI specification]] and you can see an example inception event.
To learn about future rotation key commitment, see the sections about [pre-rotation](#pre-rotation) and the KERI specification.

### Delegation KERI event details
This section focuses on delegation relationships between KERI AIDs. [DID Documents](#did-documents) introduced the core [[ref: KERI event stream]] and related DID Document concepts. This section provides additional details regarding the types of KERI delegation events and how they relate to the DID document. See [Basic KERI event details](#basic-keri-event-details) for further detail on basic KERI event types including how they relate to the DID document.

#### Delegation key state events
1. All delegation relationships MUST start with a delegated inception event.
1. Any change to the [[ref: Delegated inception event]] key state or delegated rotation event key state MUST be the result of a delegated rotation event.

::: informative Delegation event summaries
Delegated [[ref: inception event]]: Establishes a delegated identifier. Either the delegator or the delegate can end the delegation commitment.

Delegated [[ref: rotation event]]: Updates the delegated identifier commitment. Either the delegator or the delegate can end the delegation commitment.

See the [[ref: KERI specification]] for an example of a delegated inception and rotation events.
:::

Delegation service endpoints in the DID document are defined in the next section.

### Service Endpoint Event Details

This section is normative.

In did:webs, KERI-derived service endpoints are defined by **Location Scheme** (`/loc/scheme`) reply (`rpy`) messages and, for roles other than witness, **Endpoint Role Authorization** (`/end/role/add`) `rpy` messages in the [[ref: KERI event stream]]. Location Scheme records declare URL(s) for a given scheme for an AID; Endpoint Role Authorization relates a role (e.g. mailbox, agent) of one AID to another. See [KERI Service Endpoints as DID Document Metadata](#keri-service-endpoints-as-did-document-metadata). 

When the event stream (or equivalent key state and endpoint data) for a `did:webs` DID establishes a witness, mailbox, or agent the DID document MUST include the associated service endpoint(s) in its `service` array.

#### Witness Service Endpoint

1. A witness service endpoint is produced when (1) the controller AID's [[ref: KEL]] designates the witness in its witness list (inception or latest rotation event `b` field), and (2) one or more Location Scheme `rpy` messages with `r` `/loc/scheme` declare URLs for that witness AID (`a.eid`) per scheme. The witness role is thus established by key state, not by an Endpoint Role Authorization `rpy`. 
2. The DID document service entry SHALL use `type` `witness`, `id` relative to the DID of the form `#<witness-aid>/witness`, and `serviceEndpoint` as an object whose keys are scheme names and values are the declared URLs.

Location Scheme examples (witness AID declares https and tcp URLs):

```json
{
  // ...
  "t": "rpy",
  "r": "/loc/scheme",
  "a": {
    "eid": "BJqHtDoLT_K_XyOgr2ejBOqD9276TYMTg2EEqWKs-V0q",
    "scheme": "https",
    "url": "https://wit1.testnet.gleif.org:5641/"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  // ...
  "t": "rpy",
  "r": "/loc/scheme",
  "a": {
    "eid": "BJqHtDoLT_K_XyOgr2ejBOqD9276TYMTg2EEqWKs-V0q",
    "scheme": "tcp",
    "url": "tcp://wit1.testnet.gleif.org:5631/"
  }
}
```

Resulting witness service entry:

```json
{
  "id": "#BJqHtDoLT_K_XyOgr2ejBOqD9276TYMTg2EEqWKs-V0q/witness",
  "type": "witness",
  "serviceEndpoint": {
    "https": "https://wit1.testnet.gleif.org:5641/",
    "tcp": "tcp://wit1.testnet.gleif.org:5631/"
  }
}
```

#### Mailbox Service Endpoint

1. A mailbox service endpoint is produced when (1) an Endpoint Role Authorization `rpy` with `r` `/end/role/add` and `a.role` `mailbox` designates the mailbox AID (`a.eid`) for the controller AID (`a.cid`), and (2) one or more Location Scheme `rpy` messages with `r` `/loc/scheme` declare URLs for that mailbox AID. Implementations obtain mailbox endpoints from Endpoint Role data (e.g. KERI `ends` table keyed by controller and role) plus Location Scheme data (e.g. `locs` table). 
2. The DID document service entry SHALL use `type` `mailbox`, `id` relative to the DID of the form `#<mailbox-aid>/mailbox`, and `serviceEndpoint` as an object mapping scheme names to URLs (or a single URL when only one scheme applies).

Endpoint Role Authorization example (controller designates mailbox):

```json
{
  // ...
  "t": "rpy",
  "r": "/end/role/add",
  "a": {
    "cid": "Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M",
    "role": "mailbox",
    "eid": "BJqHtDoLT_K_XyOgr2ejBOqD9276TYMTg2EEqWKs-V0q"
  }
}
```

Location Scheme example (mailbox AID declares http URL):

```json
{
  // ...
  "t": "rpy",
  "r": "/loc/scheme",
  "a": {
    "eid": "BJqHtDoLT_K_XyOgr2ejBOqD9276TYMTg2EEqWKs-V0q",
    "scheme": "http",
    "url": "http://mailbox.testnet.gleif.org:5635/"
  }
}
```

Resulting mailbox service entry:

```json
{
  "id": "#BJqHtDoLT_K_XyOgr2ejBOqD9276TYMTg2EEqWKs-V0q/mailbox",
  "type": "mailbox",
  "serviceEndpoint": {
    "https": "https://mailbox.testnet.gleif.org:5635/",
  }
}
```

#### Agent Service Endpoint

1. An agent service endpoint is produced when (1) an Endpoint Role Authorization `rpy` with `r` `/end/role/add` and `a.role` `agent` designates the agent AID (`a.eid`) for the controller AID (`a.cid`), and (2) one or more Location Scheme `rpy` messages with `r` `/loc/scheme` declare URLs for that agent AID. Implementations obtain agent endpoints from Endpoint Role data (e.g. KERI `ends` table) plus Location Scheme data (e.g. `locs` table). 
2. The DID document service entry SHALL use `type` `KeriAgent` (or `agent` where registered) and `serviceEndpoint` as an object mapping scheme names to URLs or a single URL, consistent with [KERI Service Endpoints as DID Document Metadata](#keri-service-endpoints-as-did-document-metadata).

Endpoint Role Authorization example (controller designates agent):

```json
{
  // ...
  "t": "rpy",
  "r": "/end/role/add",
  "a": {
    "cid": "Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M",
    "role": "agent",
    "eid": "BJqHtDoLT_K_XyOgr2ejBOqD9276TYMTg2EEqWKs-V0q"
  }
}
```

Location Scheme example (agent AID declares http URL):

```json
{
  // ...
  "t": "rpy",
  "r": "/loc/scheme",
  "a": {
    "eid": "BJqHtDoLT_K_XyOgr2ejBOqD9276TYMTg2EEqWKs-V0q",
    "scheme": "http",
    "url": "http://agent.testnet.gleif.org:5636/"
  }
}
```

Resulting agent service entry:

```json
{
  "id": "#BJqHtDoLT_K_XyOgr2ejBOqD9276TYMTg2EEqWKs-V0q/agent",
  "type": "agent",
  "serviceEndpoint": {
    "https": "https://agent.testnet.gleif.org:5636/",
  }
}
```

#### Delegator Service Endpoint

If the first event in the [[ref: KEL]] for a `did:webs` DID is a delegated inception event of type `dip` then it MUST include a delegator service endpoint in its DID document as follows.

1. A delegated AID MUST include a service endpoint in its DID document that references its delegator.
1. When a delegator service endpoint is present, it MUST conform to the following requirements:
    1. The service `type` property MUST be set to `DelegatorOOBI`.
    1. The service `id` property MUST be the [[ref: SAID]] of the seal (anchor block) in the delegator's [[ref: KEL]] that commits to the delegate's [[ref: delegated inception event]].
    1. The service `serviceEndpoint` property MUST be a valid [[ref: OOBI]] URL that resolves to the delegator's AID.
1. The delegator service endpoint enables verifiers to discover and validate the delegation relationship by retrieving the delegator's [[ref: KEL]].

For example, a `did:webs` DID that is a delegated AID MUST include, in its `service` array of the DID document, a delegator service endpoint similar to the following:

```json
{
  "service": [{
    "id": "EDEvmKvGFjuip-J5dDw7sbVHxXA22s-pBO764CivsFt4",
    "type": "DelegatorOOBI",
    "serviceEndpoint": "http://keria:3902/oobi/ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe"
  }]
}
```

::: informative Delegator endpoint example explanation
In this example, the `id` field contains the [[ref: SAID]] of the seal in the delegator's [[ref: KEL]] that anchors the delegation commitment, and the `serviceEndpoint` provides the [[ref: OOBI]] URL to retrieve the delegator's key state so that the delegator's KEL may be searched for the delegation seal referred to by the `id` property.
:::

### Designated Aliases
1. An AID controller SHALL specify the [[ref: designated aliases]] that will be listed in the `equivalentId` and `alsoKnownAs` properties by issuing a Designated aliases verifiable attestation as an ACDC.
    1. This attestation MUST contain a set of [[ref: AID controlled identifiers]] that the AID controller authorizes.
    1. If the identifier is a `did:webs` identifier then it is truly equivalent and MUST be listed in the `equivalentId` property.
    1. If the identifier is a DID then it MUST be listed in the `alsoKnownAs` property.

#### Designated Aliases event details

::: informative Designated aliases example
This is an example [[ref: designated aliases]] [[ref: ACDC]] attestation showing five designated aliases:
```json
{
    "v": "ACDC10JSON0005f2_",
    "d": "EIGWggWL2IHiUzj1P2YuPA0-Uh55LTIu14KTvVQGrfvT",

            "did:webs:foo.com:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe"
        ]
    },
    "r": {
        // rules section content...
    }
}
```
The resulting DID document based on the [[ref: designated aliases]] attestation above, contains:
* An `equivalentId` metadata for the did:webs:foo.com identifier
* Three `alsoKnownAs` identifiers:
  * the did:webs:foo.com identifier is a Designated alias which is also in the equivalentId did document metadata.
  * the did:web:example.com is a Designated alias
  * NOTE: if the did:keri identifier were automatically generated and included from the AID then that would be a valid designated alias and alsoKnownAs value based on the AID

## did_metadata
## DID Metadata
This section is normative.

This section describes the support of the `did:webs` method for metadata, including [[ref: DID resolution metadata]] and [[ref: DID document metadata]]. This metadata is returned by a DID Resolver in addition to the DID document. Also see the [DID Resolution](https://w3c.github.io/did-resolution/) specification for further details.

### DID Resolution Metadata

At the moment, this specification does not define the use of any specific [[ref: DID resolution metadata]] properties in the `did:webs` method, but may in the future include various metadata, such as which KERI Watchers were used during the resolution process.

### DID Document Metadata

This section of the specification defines how various DID document metadata properties are used by the `did:webs` method.

#### Use of `versionId`

The `versionId` DID document metadata property indicates the current version of the DID document that has been resolved.

1. The `did:webs` versionId MUST be the sequence number (i.e. the `s` field) of the last event in the [[ref: KERI event stream]] that was used to construct the DID document according to the rules in section [DID Documents](#did-documents).
1. If the DID parameter `versionId` (see section [Support for `versionId`](#support-for-versionid)) was used when resolving the `did:webs` DID, and if the DID Resolution process was successful, then this corresponding DID document metadata property MUST be guaranteed to be equal to the value of the DID parameter.

Example:

```json
{
  "didDocument": {
    "id": "did:webs:example.com:Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M"
    // ... other properties
  },
  "didResolutionMetadata": {
  },
  "didDocumentMetadata": {
    "versionId": "2"
  }
}
```

#### Use of `nextVersionId`

The `nextVersionId` DID document metadata property indicates the next version of the DID document after the version that has been resolved.

1. The `did:webs` `nextVersionId` MUST be the sequence number (i.e. the `s` field) of the next event in the [[ref: KERI event stream]] after the last one that was used to construct the DID document according to the rules in section [DID Documents](#did-documents).
1. This DID document metadata property MUST be present if the DID parameter `versionId`
(see section [Support for `versionId`](#support-for-versionid)) was used when resolving the `did:webs` DID, and if the value of that DID parameter was not the sequence number of the last event in the KERI event stream.

Example:

```json
{
  "didDocument": {
    "id": "did:webs:example.com:Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M"
    // ... other properties
  },
  "didResolutionMetadata": {
  },
  "didDocumentMetadata": {
    "versionId": "1",
    "nextVersionId": "2"
  }
}
```

#### Use of `equivalentId`

The `equivalentId` DID document metadata property indicates other DIDs that refer to the same subject and are logically equivalent to the DID that has been resolved. It is similar to the `alsoKnownAs` DID document property (see section [Also Known As](#also-known-as)), but it has even stronger semantics, insofar as the logical equivalence is guaranteed by the DID method itself.

1. The `did:webs` `equivalentId` metadata property SHOULD contain a list of the controller AID [[ref: designated aliases]] `did:webs` DIDs that differ in the [[ref: host]] and/or port portion of the [[ref: method-specific identifier]] but share the same AID. Also see section [[ref: AID controlled identifiers]].
1. `equivalentId` depends on the controller AIDs array of [[ref: designated aliases]]. A `did:webs` identifier MUST not verify unless it is found in the `equivalentId` metadata that corresponds to the Designated aliases.

> Note that [[ref: AID controlled identifiers]] like `did:web` and `did:keri` identifiers with the same AID are not listed in `equivalentId` because they do not have the same DID method. A `did:web` identifier with the same domain and AID does not have the same security characteristics as the `did:webs` identifier. Conversely, a `did:keri` identifier with the same AID has the same security characterisitcs but not the same dependence on the web. For these reasons, they are not listed in `equivalentId`. 

Example:

```json
{
    "didDocument": {
        "id": "did:webs:did-webs-service%3a7676:ENro7uf0ePmiK3jdTo2YCdXLqW7z7xoP6qhhBou6gBLe",

## didparameters
## DID Parameters
This section is normative.

This section describes the support of the `did:webs` method for certain DID parameters.

### Support for `versionId`

The `did:webs` DID method supports the `versionId` DID parameter. This DID parameter is defined [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-parameters).

This allows clients to instruct a DID Resolver to return a specific version of a DID document, as opposed to the latest version. The `did:webs` DID method is ideally suited for this functionality, since a continuous, self-certifying stream of events lies at the heart of the DID method's design, see section [KERI Fundamentals](#keri-fundamentals).

1. Valid values for this DID parameter MUST be the sequence numbers of events in the [[ref: KERI event stream]].
1. When a `did:webs` DID is resolved with this DID parameter, a `did:webs` resolver MUST construct the DID document based on an AID's associated KERI events from the KERI event stream only up to (and including) the event with the sequence
number (i.e. the `s` field) that corresponds to the value of the `versionId` DID parameter.

::: informative versionId example
See section [DID Documents](#did-documents) for details.

Example:

```
did:webs:example.com:Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M?versionId=1
```

:::

### Support for `transformKeys`

The `did:webs` DID method supports the `transformKeys` DID parameter. This DID parameter is defined [here](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-spec-extensions/blob/main/parameters/transform-keys.md).

1. This parameter MUST be implemented for a DID Resolver to return verification methods in a DID document in a desired format, such as `JsonWebKey` or `Ed25519VerificationKey2020`.

::: informative transformKeys example
Example:

```
did:webs:example.com:Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M?transformKeys=CesrKey
```

:::

#### `CesrKey` and `publicKeyCesr`

This specification defines the following extensions to the DID document data model in accordance with the [[ref: DID Spec Registries]]:

1. Extension verification method `type` `CesrKey` MAY be available in a `did:webs` DID document to express a public key encoded in [[ref: CESR]] format.
1. Extension verification method property `publicKeyCesr` MAY be available in a `did:webs` DID document to provide a string value whose content is the CESR representation of a public key.
1. The verification method type `CesrKey` MAY be used as the value of the `transformKeys` DID parameter.

::: informative CesrKey example
For example, a KERI AID with only the following inception event in its KEL:
```json
{
  "v": "KERI10JSON0001b7_",
  "t": "icp",
  "d": "Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M",
  "i": "Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M",
  "s": "0",
  "kt": "1",
  "k": [
    "1AAAAg299p5IMvuw71HW_TlbzGq5cVOQ7bRbeDuhheF-DPYk",  // Secp256k1 Key
    "DA-vW9ynSkvOWv5e7idtikLANdS6pGO2IHJy7v0rypvE",      // Ed25519 Key
    "DLWJrsKIHrrn1Q1jy2oEi8Bmv6aEcwuyIqgngVf2nNwu"       // Ed25519 Key
  ],
  // ...
}
```
and given the following the DID URL:
```
did:webs:example.com:Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M?transformKeys=CesrKey
```
would result in a DID document with the following verification methods array:
```json
{
  "verificationMethod": [
    {
      "id": "#1AAAAg299p5IMvuw71HW_TlbzGq5cVOQ7bRbeDuhheF-DPYk",
      "type": "CesrKey",
      "controller": "did:webs:example.com:Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M",
      "publicKeyCesr": "1AAAAg299p5IMvuw71HW_TlbzGq5cVOQ7bRbeDuhheF-DPYk"
    },
    {
      "id": "#DA-vW9ynSkvOWv5e7idtikLANdS6pGO2IHJy7v0rypvE",
      "type": "CesrKey",
      "controller": "did:webs:example.com:Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M",
      "publicKeyCesr": "DA-vW9ynSkvOWv5e7idtikLANdS6pGO2IHJy7v0rypvE"
    },
    {
      "id": "#DLWJrsKIHrrn1Q1jy2oEi8Bmv6aEcwuyIqgngVf2nNwu",
      "type": "CesrKey",
      "controller": "did:webs:example.com:Ew-o5dU5WjDrxDBK4b4HrF82_rYb6MX6xsegjq4n0Y7M",
      "publicKeyCesr": "DLWJrsKIHrrn1Q1jy2oEi8Bmv6aEcwuyIqgngVf2nNwu"
    }
  ]
}

## security_considerations
## Security Considerations
This section is normative.

There are many security considerations related to web requests, storing information securely, etc. It is useful to address these considerations along with the common security threats found on the web. 

### Common security threats

1. All `did:webs` features MUST reduce the attack surface against common threats:
    1. Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) attacks MUST be eliminated or reduced.
    1. Denial of service (DoS) attacks MUST be eliminated or reduced.
    1. Deletion attacks MUST be eliminated or reduced.
    1. Duplicity detection MUST be available and reliable.
    1. Eclipse attacks MUST be eliminated or reduced.
    1. Forgery attacks MUST be eliminated or reduced.
    1. Impersonation attacks MUST be eliminated or reduced.
    1. Key Compromise attacks MUST be eliminated or reduced.
    1. Malleability attacks MUST be eliminated or reduced.
    1. Replay attacks MUST be eliminated or reduced.

### Using HTTPS
Perfect protection from eavesdropping is not possible with HTTPS, for various
reasons.
1. URLs of DID documents and [[ref: KERI event streams]] SHOULD be hosted in a way that embodies accepted cybersecurity best practice. This is not strictly necessary to guarantee the authenticity of the data. However, the usage:
    1. MUST safeguard privacy
    1. MUST discourage denial of service
    1. MUST work in concert with defense-in-depth mindset
    1. MUST aid regulatory compliance
    1. MUST allow for high-confidence fetches of the DID document and a KERI event stream
1. A [[ref: host]] that uses a fully qualified domain name of the [[ref: method-specific identifier]] MUST be secured by a TLS/SSL certificate.
    1. The fully qualified domain name MUST match the common name used in the SSL/TLS certificate.
    1. The common name in the SSL/TLS certificate from the server MUST correspond to the way the server is referenced in the URL. This means that if the URL includes `www.example.com`, the common name in the SSL/TLS certificate must be `www.example.com` as well.
1. Unlike `did:web`, the URL MAY use an IP address instead.
    1. If it does, then the common name in the certificate MUST be the IP address as well.
1. Essentially, the URL and the certificate MUST NOT identify the server in contradictory ways; subject to that constraint, how the server is identified is flexible.
    1. The server certificate MAY be self-issued
    1. OR it MAY chain back to an unknown certificate authority. However, to ensure reasonable security hygiene, it MUST be valid. This has two meanings, both of which are required:
1. The certificate MUST satisfy whatever requirements are active in the client, such that the client does accept the certificate and use it to build and communicate over the encrypted HTTPS session where a DID document and KERI event stream are fetched.
1. The certificate MUST pass some common-sense validity tests, even if the client is very permissive:
    1. It MUST have a valid signature
    1. It MUST NOT be expired or revoked or deny-listed
    1. It MUST NOT have any broken links in its chain of trust.
1. If a URL of a DID document or KERI event streams results in a redirect, each URL MUST satisfy the same security requirements.
`www.example.com` as well.

### International Domain Names

1. As with `did:web`, implementers of `did:webs` SHOULD consider how non-ASCII characters manifest in URLs and DIDs.
    1. `did:webs` MUST follow the [[ref: DID-CORE]] identifier syntax which does not allow the direct representation of such characters in method name or method specific identifiers. This prevents a `did:webs` value from embodying a homograph attack.
    1. However, `did:webs` MAY hold data encoded with punycode or percent encoding. This means that IRIs constructed from DID values could contain non-ASCII characters that were not obvious in the DID, surprising a casual human reader.
    1. Caution is RECOMMENDED when treating a `did:webs` as the equivalent of an IRI.
    1. Treating it as the equivalent of a URL, instead, is RECOMMENDED as it preserves the punycode and percent encoding and is therefore safe.

### Concepts for securing `did:webs` information

The following security concepts are used to secure the data, files, signatures and other information in `did:webs`.
1. All security features and concepts in `did:webs` MUST use one or more of the following mechanisms:
    1. All data that requires the highest security MUST be [[ref: KEL]] backed. This includes any information that needs to be end-verifiably authentic over time:
        1. All [[ref: ACDCs]] used by a `did:webs` identifier MUST be one of the following:
            1. MAY be anchored to a KEL directly.
            1. MAY be anchored indirectly through a [[ref: TEL]] that itself is anchored to a KEL.
    1. All data that does not need to incur the cost of [[ref: KEL]] backing for secuirty but can benefit from the latest data-state such as a distributed data-base MUST use _Best Available Data - Read, Update, Nullify_ ([[ref: BADA-RUN]]).
        1. BADA-RUN information MUST be ordered in a consistent way, using the following:
            1. date-time MUST be used.
            1. key state MUST be used.
        1. Discovery information MAY use BADA-RUN because the worst-case attack on discovery information is a DDoS attack where nothing gets discovered.
            1. The controller(s) of the AID for a `did:webs` identifier MAY use  BADA-RUN for service end-points as discovery mechanisms.
    2. All data that does not need the security of being KEL backed nor BADA-RUN SHOULD be served using _KERI Request Authentication Mechanism_ ([[ref: KRAM]]).
        1. For a `did:webs` resolver to be trusted it SHOULD use KRAM to access the service endpoints providing KERI event streams for verification of the DID document.

#### Reducing the attack surface
::: informative Reducing the attack surface

The above considerations have lead us to focus on KEL backed DID document blocks and data (designated alias ACDCs, signatures, etc) so that the trusted (local) did:webs resolver is secure. Any future features that could leverage BADA-RUN and [[ref: KRAM]] should be considered carefully according to the above considerations.

See the implementors guide for more details about KEL backed, BADA-RUN, and KRAM:
* [[ref: On-Disk Storage]]
* [Alignment of Information to Security Posture](#alignment-of-information-to-security-posture)
* [Applying the concepts of KEL, BADA-RUN, and KRAM](#applying-the-concepts-of-kel)

## privacy_considerations
## Privacy Considerations
::: informative Privacy Considerations

This section addresses the privacy considerations from [RFC6973](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6973) section 5.
For privacy considerations related to web infrastructure, see [`did:web` privacy considerations](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/#security-and-privacy-considerations).
Below we discuss privacy considerations related the KERI infrastructure.

### Surveillance

In KERI, a robust witness network along with consistent witness rotation provides protection from monitoring and association of
an individual's activity inside a KERI network.

### Stored Data Compromise

For resolvers that simply discover the Key State endorsed by another party in a discovery network, caching policies
of that network would guide stored data security considerations.  In the event that a resolver is also the endorsing party,
meaning they have their own KERI identifier and are verifying the KEL and signing the Key State themselves, leveraging the
facilities provided by the KERI protocol (key rotation, witness maintenance, multi-sig) should be used to protect the identities
used to sign the Key State.

### Unsolicited Traffic

DID Documents are not required to provide endpoints and thus not subject to unsolicited traffic.

### Misattribution

This DID Method relies on KERI's duplicity detection to determine when the non-repudiable controller of a DID
has been inconsistent and can no longer be trusted.  This establishment of non-repudiation enables consistent attribution.

### Correlation

The root of trust for KERI identifiers is entropy and therefore offers no direct means of correlation.  In addition, KERI provides
two modes of communication, direct mode and indirect mode.  Direct mode allows for pairwise (n-wise as well) relationships that
can be used to establish private relationships.

See the KERI specification for [more information about direct and indirect modes](https://trustoverip.github.io/kswg-keri-specification/#introduction).

### Identification

The root of trust for KERI identifiers is entropy and therefore offers no direct means of identification.  In addition, KERI provides
two modes of communication, direct mode and indirect mode.  Direct mode allows for pairwise (n-wise as well) relationships that
can be used to establish private relationships.

See the KERI specification for [more information about secure bindings and prefix derivation](https://trustoverip.github.io/kswg-keri-specification/#keris-secure-bindings)

### Secondary Use

The Key State made available in the metadata of this DID method is generally available and can be used by any party
to retrieve and verify the state of the KERL for the given identifier.

### Disclosure

No data beyond the Key State for the identifier is provided by this DID method.

### Exclusion

This DID method provides no opportunity for [correlation](#correlation), [identification](#identification) or
[disclosure](#disclosure) and therefore there is no opportunity to exclude the controller from knowing about data that others have
about them.
